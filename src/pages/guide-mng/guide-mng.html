  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Betting Money Management</h2>
  <h3>A very important part of sports betting. Betting without money management can be disastrous.</h3>
  <hr>
  <h4>Flat unit stakes</h4>
  <p>With flat unit betting stakes you always bet the same amount.</p>
  <p>Choose how much a unit is worth <em>(between 3% and 5% of your bank)</em>. The games are then put into three categories - 1, 2 and 3 unit plays. 1 unit means - it's a risky game, 2 is regular, 3 is a game well worth betting on.</p>
  <p><strong>You should never bet more than three units!</strong></p>
  <p>This is the most widely used money management with professional bettors. It's popular to revaluate the unit at the end of the season. It depends on your bank how much it has grown or shrunk, take 3-5% of it and this is your new unit.</p>
  <p>Another important factor when using units is - always keep your odds close to 2.0!</p>
  <hr>
  <h4>Martingale</h4>
  <p>Double your stake every time you lose. An example: Bet 2€ on a game. If you've won, bet 2€ in the next game. If you lost, double your stake and bet 4€ on your next bet. If you lost again, bet 8€!</p>
  <p>Always double your stake if you lost. Once you win, you'll get everything back + make the 2€ you bet in the first place. You have to be careful to choose games with odds of at least 2.0, otherwise, you won't get back in the game and constantly lose money.</p>
  <p>Martingale is popular in casino games, where you can try it on Roulette or BlackJack (21). Keep betting on black (always double your stake if lost) and sooner or later you'll win.</p>
  <hr>
  <h4>Reversed Martingale</h4>
  <p>Double your stake only if you win. If you start with 2€, win a bet at 2.0, and lose - you'll continue with the 2€ stake. If you've won - you'll bet 4€ on your next bet. In case you've won - bet 8€ and so on. Always double your last winning stake. If you lost, return to the 2€ stake.</p>
  <p>This system can make you a lot of money if you're on a winning streak.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>We recommend using the unit stakes. Whatever you choose, everything is better than betting without discipline and a plan.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">15 bets in a row</h2>
  <h3>Can you pick a winner, not once, not twice, but 15 times in a row?</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Start with 5€ and bet them on one or more matches (single, or accumulator bets) with a single or combined odds of <strong>2.25.</strong></p>
  <p>If you win - keep 25% of winnings on your account and bet the rest on another bet at 2.25. Continue doing that for 15 rounds. In the 14th round, keep 57% and bet the rest, in the final round - withdraw everything.</p>
  <hr>
  <h4 style="margin-bottom: 40px;">If you get through all 15 rounds, you'll make about 20.000€!</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>If you fail one round, go 2 steps back. Three consecutive losses will put you back to round 1. It can happen, but you can lose only 5€! Everything else is bookies money anyway.</p>
  <p>Think about it - 5€ investment and 20.000€ potential profit. Well worth trying.</p>
